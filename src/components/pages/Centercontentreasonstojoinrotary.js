        <h1>20 Reasons for Joining Rotary</h1>
        <br />
        <h2>These are the most popular reasons for joining Rotary</h2>
        <br />
        <h3>1.Friendship / Fellowship / Community</h3>
        In an increasingly complex world, Rotary provides one of the most basic
        human needs: the need for friendship and fellowship. It is one of two
        reasons whyRotary began in 1905.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>2.Business Development</h3>
        The second original reason for Rotary's beginning is business
        development. Everyone needs to network. Rotary consists of a
        cross¬section of every business community. Its members come from all
        walks of life. Rotarians help each other and collectively help others.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>3.Personal Growth and Development</h3>
        Membership in Rotary ensures continuing growth and education in human
        relations and personal development.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>4.Leadership Development</h3>
        Rotary is an organisation of leaders and successful people. Serving in
        Rotary positions is like a college education. Leadership is all about
        learning how to motivate, influence and lead leaders.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>5.Citizenship in the Community</h3>
        Membership in a Rotary club helps develop better community citizens. The
        average Rotary club consists of the most active citizens of any
        community.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>6.Continuing Education</h3> At each Rotary meeting, there is a
        programme designed to keep members informed about what is going on in
        the community, nation and world. Each meeting provides an opportunity to
        listen to different speakers on a variety of timely topics.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>7.Fun (with a purpose)</h3>
        Rotary is a fun and exciting place to be.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>8.Prestige</h3>
        Rotary members are prominent people: leaders of business, the
        professions, art, government, sports, military, religion, and all
        disciplines. Rotary is the oldest and most prestigious service club in
        the world. Its ranks include executives, managers, and professionals -
        people who make decisions and influence policy.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>9.Citizenship in the World</h3>
        Every Rotarian wears a pin that says "Rotary International." There are
        few places on the globe that do not have a Rotary club. Every Rotarian
        is welcome - even encouraged - to attend any of the 30,000 clubs in 194
        nations and geographical regions. This encourages new friendships in
        both local and world communities.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>10.Assistance When Traveling</h3>
        Traveling Rotarians can secure medical and professional assistance as
        well as services and advice from fellow Rotarians throughout the world.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>11.Public Speaking Skills</h3>
        Many individuals who joined Rotary were uncomfortable about speaking in
        public. Rotary develops confidence and skill in public communication and
        the opportunity to practice and perfect these skills.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>12.Entertainment</h3>
        Every Rotary club and district has parties and activities that
        contribute to a diverse, yet professional business life. Rotary holds
        conferences, conventions, assemblies, and institutes that provide
        entertainment in addition to Rotary information, education, and service.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>13.Development of Social Skills</h3>
        Every meeting and at various events and functions, Rotary develops one's
        personality, social skills and people skills. Rotary is for people who
        like people.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>14.Family Programmes</h3>
        Rotary provides one of the world's largest youth exchange programs; high
        school and college clubs for future Rotarians; opportunities for spouse
        involvement; and a host of activities designed to help family members in
        growth and the development of family values.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>15.Vocational Skills</h3>
        Every Rotarian is expected to take part in the growth and development of
        his or her own profession or vocation; to serve on committees and to
        teach youth about jobs or vocations. Rotary helps to make each
        individual a better doctor, lawyer, teacher, etc.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>16.The Development of Ethics</h3>
        Rotarians practice a 4¬Way Test that governs their ethical standards.
        Rotarians are expected to be ethical in business and personal
        relationships.
        <h3>17.Cultural Awareness</h3>
        Around the world, practically every religion, country, culture, race,
        creed, political persuasion, language, colour and ethnic identity is
        represented among members of Rotary. Rotary is a cross-section of the
        world's most prominent citizens who are aware of their cultures and have
        developed a love of working with people everywhere. They become better
        citizens of their countries in the process.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>18.Nice People</h3>
        Rotarians are nice people!
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>19.Absence of an Official Creed</h3>
        Rotary has no secret handshake, no official creed, no secret meetings or
        rituals. It is an open society of men and women who simply believe in
        helping others.
        <br />
        <br />
        <h3>20.Opportunity to Serve</h3>
        As a service club, Rotary's business is mankind and its product is
        service. This is perhaps the best reason for becoming a Rotarian: the
        chance to do good.
