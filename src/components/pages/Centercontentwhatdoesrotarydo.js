        <h1>Concept of Rotary</h1>
        Rotary is a Global Network of 1.2 million neighbors, friends, leaders,
        and problem-solvers who see a world where people unite and take action
        to create lasting change – across the globe, in our communities, and in
        ourselves.
        <br />
        <br />
        Solving Real Problems takes real commitment and vision. For more than
        110 years, Rotary's people of action have used their passion, energy,
        and intelligence to take action on sustainable projects. From literacy
        and peace to water and health, we are always working to better our
        world, and we stay committed to the end.
        <br />
        <br />
        Rotary members believe that we have a Shared Responsibility to take
        action on our world’s most persistent issues. Our 35,000+ clubs work
        together to:
        <br />
        • Promote peace
        <br />
        • Fight disease
        <br />
        • Provide clean water, sanitation, and hygiene
        <br />
        • Save mothers and children
        <br />
        • Support education
        <br />
        • Grow local economies
        <br />

        <h4>Rotarians think differently</h4>: We apply leadership and expertise

        members can be found in your community and across the globe
        <br /> <br />
        As a global network that strives to build a world where people unite and
        take action to create lasting change, Rotary values diversity and
        celebrates the contributions of people of all backgrounds, regardless of
        their age, ethnicity, race, color, abilities, religion, socioeconomic
        status, culture, sex, sexual orientation, and gender identity <br />
        <br />
        Rotarians promote international understanding and good will by means of
        material, technical, and professional assistance to their local
        communities and beyond.
        <br /> <br />
        In addition, Rotarians are people who engage in business or the
        corporate world with the highest standards of integrity and impact the
        community positively. <br /> <br />
        Rotary eschews treating one’s vocation as an opportunity to serve a feat
        guided by the Rotary motto of Service Above Self most have taken up with
        zeal. <br /> <br />
        Rotarians are supposed to do all in their power to dignify their
        vocations and to promote the highest ethical standards in their chosen
        vocations.
        <br /> <br />
        Beneath the good works of Rotary there is an invisible power. It is the
        power of good will and by virtue of the power of good will; Rotary
        exists.
        <br /> <br />
        Friendship is an evangelizing force. Thousands of men and women are born
        anew in the spirit of Rotary, into old fashioned friendliness and
        neighborliness.”
