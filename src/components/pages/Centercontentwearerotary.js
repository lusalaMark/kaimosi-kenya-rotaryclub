          We have been together as Kaimosi Rotary Club for only three months. To
          understand where we are, let’s take a step back to see how it all
          began.
          <br />
          Sometimes in November 2018, I (Billy Jivetti, now Patron) was invited
          by a Friends Quaker family to visit their home in South Colorado. He
          is a retired medical doctor who has travelled the world on matters
          relating to population health. We spend two nights at their home. In
          our conversation, he mentioned to me that his rotary club would be
          interested in supporting girl child education activities in Africa and
          at an opportune moment, they would reach out to me for recommendations
          for a community to work with. We reconnected again in 2020 via email
          and my friend introduced me to Pine River Valley Rotary Club in
          Colorado. In July 2020, I was invited for a meeting with the
          leadership of Pine River Valley Rotary Club. After my presentation,
          thy became interested in working with us. The main question they asked
          was “Is there a Rotary Club near Kaimosi town that we can work with?”
          <br />
          <br />
          I remembered and reached out to my Kaimosi Junior primary school mate
          Kenyatta Otiento (a Rotarian in Nairobi). He connected me with a
          Canadian-Kenyan (80 years old), and who has been a founder member of
          the Kakamega Rotary Club. He also introduced me to Madam Jane Rogo
          (then Treasurer) of Sagam Rotary Club in Siaya County who responded
          positively and connected me with Prof. James Ombaka. I then introduced
          Prof. Ombaka to the Colorado team, and he volunteered to visit Kaimosi
          on September 12 as requested. Prof. Ombaka’s feedback/report was so
          encouraging and the team agreed to work with Sagam Club. It also
          became evident that we needed a rotary club in Kaimosi, to partner
          with Sagam for effectiveness. I requested both Prof. Ombaka and Madam
          Jane, and they wholeheartedly agreed to sponsor, mentor, and guide
          Kaimosi Rotary Club to its charter. <br />
          <br />
          After much soul-searching, I reached out to someone I was told has
          some influence among the professionals in Kaimosi Complex and the
          community around – Madam Lydia Songole. She has led several women
          self-help groups in around Kaimosi. After hosting Prof. Ombaka, she
          took a keen interest and helped recruit Hesborn, Patrick, Scritta, and
          Sinjaa among others. These people also recruited others and we had a
          quorum that held our first meeting on October 4, 2020. During this
          meeting, we shared the dream and vision for development in our Kaimosi
          Complex using rotary club as a vehicle. <br />
          <br />
          We meet, learn a about Rotary International, and possible activities
          we can engage in our communities around Kaimosi.
          <br />
          <br />
          As of today, we have a good team that has resolved to partner and work
          with Sagam Rotary Club. To that end, we pay special tribute to Sagam
          Club for their unwavering support and willingness to work with
          Kaimosi.
          <br />
          <br />
          We are so grateful, to have been gifted with diverse skills and
          professionals in our team. For instance, we have a very experienced VP
          who has travelled across Kenyan communities, witnessing development
          programs. He is providing the much-needed guidance and we are
          privileged to have such people on our team. Our treasurer has also
          been involved with various youth programs in the community. We also
          have some business people with us. Then, we have a few “Friends of
          Kaimosi Rotary Club” currently residing in other cities and towns, but
          who are willing to walk with us on this journey. <br />
          <br />
          Our performance Since the first meeting, we have tried. I would rank
          us highly for the achievements we have attained, and above all,
          staying above board. Like most start-ups, we are also prone to similar
          challenges like scepticism, optimism, and declining participation in
          meetings. Nevertheless, we can attest to the prevailing commitment and
          focus. <br />
          <br />
          We Resolve Today, more than ever, we present a collective resolve to
          birth this dream – Kaimosi Rotary Club. Prophet Isaiah forewarned us
          that the journey ahead is rife with valleys, mountains, hills, rough
          grounds, and even rugged places (Isaiah 40:4). <br />
          <br />
          However, we have been called to action (2 Chronicles 7:14), for such a
          time as this (Esther_4:14). We remember the Quaker missionaries who
          decided to pitch tent in Kaimosi in early 1900s. They saw the
          potential of our people, land, and cultures. Therefore, in humility,
          as we pray and seek God, he will hear from heaven, and will heal our
          beautiful land – Kaimosi (2 Chronicles 7: 14). <br />
          <br />
          We, Kaimosi Rotary Club resolve to fulfil this very purpose through
          service to God, the people and its cultures, and our landscapes around
          Kaimosi. <br />
          <br />
          We have been together as Kaimosi Rotary Club for only three months. To
          understand where we are, let’s take a step back to see how it all
          began.
