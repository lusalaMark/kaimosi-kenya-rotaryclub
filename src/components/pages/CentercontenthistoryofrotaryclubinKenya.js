            <h2>Rotary Club of Nairobi</h2>
            <br />
            The Rotary Club of Nairobi was founded with a luncheon at New
            Stanley Hotel on 11th March 1930.The driving force to this great
            achievement was Rotarian John Innes from Leeds, who had been
            inspired when Rotary’s Founder Father, Paul Harris visited his club
            in England two years earlier and encouraged him to use his next
            business trip to East Africa to initiate a new Rotary Club.
            <br /> <br />
            Over the years, the club grew in leaps and bounds and its members
            comprised people who made a difference in the growing colony all the
            way to post independence and present-day Kenya. Currently there are
            over 50 Rotary clubs in Kenya with a total membership of over 1300
            members.
